        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>Way back in the early 90's I started getting into this new fangled world wide web. Back in those days things were very simple. Alas life got in the way and I shelved my aspirations to become a web developer.</p>
        <p>Now way later in life things have come full circle and well, here I am again trying to fill my head full of knowledge.</p>
        <p>I feel the timing is right and the old saying it's never too late seems all the more true!</p>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>Video games, Dad stuff, outdoors. Tinkering with electonics. Paying the rent, keeping the lights on.</p>
        <p>With all of that, it seems I barely have a dull moment.</p>
        <p>I see web development as a life long pursuit with no finish line. There will always be emerging tech to learn and master.</p>
